# What to accomplish
- I made the task as smart home mini project. controling leds with switches 
and get states of the leds in home, send temp degree frequently.   
# process 
- Split the project into small functions each one to make small thing.
  - Make interrupt on switch to light the led when pressed .
  - Use UART serial communication to send data to serial monitor.
  - Use ADC to convert analog temp sensor to digital values to deal with it.
  - Use Timer to interrupt every 3 seconds to send data to serial monitor.
  
# Experience 
- Very good with C.
- Very good with tiva c launchpad.
- good with keil IDE.
